Adaptive Card thoughts
	with each request for assistance in the stack, associate a unique QnA identifier with the message, BUT DISPLAY THE SAME TEXT IN REQUESTING FOR HELP
	EX:
		Video
			What seems to be the problem?
				Low Quality
					Suggestion 1 (QnA response 1)
					Did this work?
						Yes
							What else can I help you with? (call method again, I think?)
						No (card reads "No," but QnA request processed as 1)

					No
					Suggestion 2 (QnA response as a function of QnA request of 1)
					Did this work?
